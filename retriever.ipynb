Most cases of CRC are detected in Western countries, with its incidence \\nincreasing year by year. The probability of suffering from colorectal cancer is about 4%-5% and the \\nrisk for developing CRC is associated with personal features or habits such as age, chronic disease \\nhistory and lifestyle. In this context, the gut microbiota has a relevant role, and dysbiosis situations \\ncan induce colonic carcinogenesis through a chronic inflammation mechanism. Some of the bacteria \\nresponsible for this multiphase process include Fusobacterium spp, Bacteroides fragilis and \\nenteropathogenic Escherichia coli. CRC is caused by mutations that target oncogenes, tumour \\nsuppressor genes and genes related to DNA repair mechanisms. Depending on the origin of the \\nmutation, colorectal carcinomas can be classified as sporadic (70%); inherited (5%) and familial \\n(25%). The pathogenic mechanisms leading to this situation can be included in three types, namely \\nchromosomal instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI) and CpG island methylator phenotype \\n(CIMP). Within these types of CRC, common mutations, chromosomal changes and translocations \\nhave been reported to affect important pathways (WNT, MAPK/PI3K, TGF-β, TP53), and mutations; \\nin particular, genes such as c-MYC, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, SMAD2 and SMAD4 can be \\nused as predictive markers for patient outcome. In addition to gene mutations, alterations in ncRNAs, \\nsuch as lncRNA or miRNA, can also contribute to different steps of the carcinogenesis process and \\nhave a predictive value when used as biomarkers. In consequence, different panels of genes and \\nmRNA are being developed to improve prognosis and treatment selection. The choice of first-line \\ntreatment in CRC follows a multimodal approach based on tumour-related characteristics and usually \\ncomprises surgical resection followed by chemotherapy combined with monoclonal antibodies or \\nproteins against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth receptor (EGFR). \\nBesides traditional chemotherapy, alternative therapies (such as agarose tumour macrobeads, anti-\\ninflammatory drugs, probiotics, and gold-based drugs) are currently being studied to increase \\ntreatment effectiveness and reduce side effects. \\n \\nKeywords: agarose macrobeads; anti-inflammatories; biomarkers; colorectal carcinoma; functional \\nfood; gene-expression profiling; metal-based drugs; microbiota; ncRNA; probiotics.
